Viewing a diff between two versions
 of the same file helped me better 
 spot a difference between the two. 
 It is especially useful when a 
 previous version worked while a 
 newer version does not. Diff really 
 helps you easily spot typos. 
 Overall it makes spot bugs faster. 

 Having access to the entire history
 of a file allows you to see your 
 though process and see what mistakes
 and revision that you needed to make.
 Allowing you to better review them
 if you need to make similiar revisions
 in the future.

 The pros of manually choosing commits
 is that you are able to choose logical
 save points. The con is that you risk
 user error where you forget to save.

 I think Git allows for version control
 on multiple files at together because
 coding projects often involve more than
 multiple files with changes that would 
 affect one another while this isn't a
 a common issue with regular documents.

 Git log shows a log of previous saved
 versions with a mini description of
 changes made for that version. Git
 diff allows you to compare two saved
 version line by line.

 version control makes you more confident
 because you know that if something breaks
 you can revert to an older version or 
 compare version to see which changes
 may have caused the bug.

 I want to try using git for my own projects.

I should go back and add the questions and
commit changes for each question.
